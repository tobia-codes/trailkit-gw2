# Next session — handoff

Last updated: 2026-11-01 (end of session 6, after PR #50).

## Where we are

- **Phase 0 + 0b complete.** Daily archive runs (sometimes hours late).
- **Phase 1 (trailkit-memo standalone):** steps 1 (storage), 2 (tree & note
  view), 3 (editing, M51–M57), 3b (own word-wrapping editor with preview,
  M58–M64) and **3c (chat-link chips, M75–M77)** are merged into `develop`
  and tested in game by the user. Decisions M16–M85 in
  `docs/plans/addons/trailkit-memo.md`.
- Order from here (M28 as amended by M58, M62, M65):
  ~~visual & interaction tests (M65)~~ (done, PR #21) → ~~font subsetting
  (M62)~~ (done, PR #25: release DLL 2.1 MB) → ~~3c chat-link chips~~
  (done, PRs #39–#47) → reset kinds
  (M13) → drag & drop → search → trash & undo → settings window → export/import
  → backups → help page → **release preparation** (full test, screenshots
  M67, docs).
- Late session 5 (PRs #26–#30): bold/italic/link toggle off from anywhere
  inside the span (M68, M71, parsed with `markdown::inline_ranges`), toolbar
  buttons light up for the formatting at the cursor (M69), ≡ is gold while the
  note list is visible (M71), roomier unsaved-changes dialog with a border,
  right-aligned primary and stacked buttons in narrow windows (M70).
  Snapshot tests are strict now (no differing pixels; CI renders identically).
- Session 6 (PRs #33–#50), all tested in game by the user:
  - Layout: drawer scrim really dims (#33), editor and preview always side
    by side (M72), narrower note list + earlier drawer while previewing
    (M73), fixed note-list width (M74), note title stays at the top while
    the content scrolls (M81).
  - Dev loop (R70): auto-merge with required checks on `develop` (user set
    branch protection + `allow_auto_merge`), docs-only PRs skip the
    Windows job (verified, ~40 s), CI runs on push only for `main`,
    pre-push also runs `cargo xwin clippy` for the Windows target.
  - **3c chat-link chips** (M75–M77, M80–M82): `trailkit_ui::chat_link`
    decodes every link type locally, `chat_link_chip` draws them (icon at
    85 % of the text size, centered on the capitals; 3 px radius; slim);
    click copies in view/preview, atomic in the editor; warning chip for
    broken codes. Names later via core (C15); slash commands `/w`, `/e`
    with core (M76); never touch the game chat (C16); "open in wiki" → BL10.
  - Text: line height 1.5 × (token `font.line_height`, M78); whole memo
    window uses the body font (list and note had different sizes); text
    size setting `text_scale` (default 112.5 %, Ctrl+mouse wheel, Ctrl+0,
    percentage tooltip, fonts rebuilt only after the wheel rests; M79/M80).
  - Fixes: keyboard sink stays in view in scrolled editors (keys went to
    the game in long notes, M83); tooltips start right of GW2's large
    cursor (`cursor_extent`, M84); text-button labels centered by their
    capitals (`draw_button`, M85).
- Session 5 also: Open Sans replaces Noto Sans (M62), panes with padding
  (`lay-pane-padding`), drawer + menu button (M48), titles flush left with
  right-aligned badges (M49), bold groups with note count (M50), in-window
  dialogs (`overlay-dialog-scope`), Escape via Nexus registration.

## ▶ Resume here

1. **Quick in-game check of the last fixes** (user had not seen them yet):
   button labels centered (M85, "Done"/"Cancel" at 112.5 %). The user
   confirmed: tooltips (M84), keyboard in long notes (M83), chips.
2. Then **grill reset kinds (M13)** — next phase-1 step.
3. UI tests: `cargo xtask ui-test [--update]`; look at the PNGs in
   `tests/snapshots/` (and `failures/`) before deploying UI changes.
4. Token economy (user asked): keep tool output short (`| tail`/`grep`, also
   for `git push` — the pre-push hook prints all tests), look at snapshot
   PNGs only when they changed, avoid re-reading files.

## Facts learned in session 6 (also in the skills)

- The keyboard sink must stay **in view**: ImGui does not activate an
  input scrolled out of its window, and Nexus then sends every key to the
  game (M83, nexus-addon-dev skill).
- Open Sans sits low in ImGui's line-box centering; center by the capitals
  (`glyph_metrics::capital_middle`) — text buttons via `draw_button` (M85).
  Lucide icons fill the whole line box: a 16 px "H" is 9 px tall, the icon
  square 15 px.
- `DrawListMut` is a singleton in imgui-rs: shared components draw through
  the raw `ImDrawList_*` calls when a caller may hold one (dialog card).
- Tooltip position = mouse + 24 px × `style.MouseCursorScale`; `StyleScope`
  sets the scale from the measured cursor (`cursor_extent`).
- Nexus font resizes (`resize_font`) flicker; debounce them (text size).
- The test harness fonts are 16 px; in game the body is FontUI × 1.125
  (18 px) — measure in-game screenshots when sizes matter
  (`png_measure`-style pixel checks worked well).
- Auto mode blocks: changing branch protection (user ran it) and
  `git commit --amend` (use a follow-up commit).

## Nexus / ImGui facts learned in session 5 (also in the nexus-addon-dev skill)

- Nexus consumes **Escape** before ImGui → always `GUI_RegisterCloseOnEscape`.
- Nexus routes **key presses** (arrows, Backspace, Enter) to ImGui only while
  a real ImGui text input is active (`WantTextInput`); custom widgets keep an
  invisible input active ("keyboard sink" in `trailkit_ui::editor::view`).
- `IsWindowHovered` is false while any item is active → use
  `ALLOW_WHEN_BLOCKED_BY_ACTIVE_ITEM`.
- ImGui 1.80: alpha 0 windows skip all items; `CalcTextSize` rounds up per
  call (measure glyphs with `ImFont_CalcTextSizeA`); no `BeginDisabled`;
  dragging where no item is moves the window (`movable(false)` on children);
  child backgrounds render into the parent's draw list, so a `ChildBg` scrim
  sits below earlier siblings — draw the dimming rectangle in the scrim's own
  draw list (PR #33, trailkit-ui skill §4).
- Nexus keeps fonts per identifier until the game restarts (font changes
  need a restart, not a hot reload).
- The game's hover cursor (gear, speech bubble) leaks through addon windows —
  Nexus issue; Discord message drafted for the user.

## Open with the user

- Sales volumes for a future flipping addon: DataWars2 (api.datawars2.ie,
  Hetzner DE, polls every 4 min) vs GW2BLTC differ by factor 3–10; one hour
  of own 1-minute collection matched Mithril roughly, not ecto/mystic coin.
  Silver (DataWars2) answered 2026-11-01: free use and archiving allowed,
  attribution up to us, nginx may log IPs (see BACKLOG BL9). He confirmed the
  `calculate_sold` branch looks wrong (untested `-total > cutoff` case
  overstates `listed`); the user sent him the fix (use the `else` formula). GW2BLTC e-mail
  drafted, no answer known.
  A 24 h own collection needs an always-on machine (backend, BL5).
  PieOrCake also has a `flip_out` addon (not looked at).
- Nexus hover-cursor issue: user may post the drafted Discord message.

## Recurring checks

- GW2 wiki (2026-10-31): still behind Cognito login → Wayback workaround stays.
- C-703/25 P (checked 2026-11-01, start of phase 1): still pending, no
  hearing date or judgment reported; DPF in force. Microsoft intervened for the
  Commission; noyb asked for repeal (2026-06-30) but has not sued yet.
- DPF reminder workflow: the 2026-11-01 08:00 cron was silently skipped by
  GitHub; triggered manually (issue #11). If it skips again on 2026-12-01,
  grill round on moving the cron off the full hour.
- Daily archive: WvW EU snapshot Fri 2026-11-06 17:23 UTC is the real test of
  the cron delay margin (D29).

## User to-dos

- Add + verify `tobiacodes@gmail.com` on GitHub (Settings → Emails).
- Verify "trailkit" in TMview + DPMAregister.
- Google Alert for C-703/25 (D18).
- Optional: add `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"` to `~/.bashrc`.

## Environment notes

- GW2 addons folder: `C:\Guild Wars 2\addons` (WSL: `/mnt/c/Guild Wars 2/addons`);
  Nexus log: `addons/Nexus/Nexus.log` (readable from WSL for diagnostics).
- `cargo xtask deploy trailkit-memo` hot-reloads the addon in a running game.
- Node 24 via fnm, pnpm 11.17.0 already installed.
- `gh` is logged in as `tobia-codes` (ssh).
